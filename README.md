# Seed Planter

## Overview

This is an editor script designed for Unity that allows you to populate a surface with objects easily. ~~Unlike traditional terrain tools, this script does not create terrain instances but instead spawns **GameObjects** in your scene~~ You can now also convert your objects to Terrain tree instances/prototypes.

## Features

- **Easy Setup**: Simply create a `SeedObjectData` file via `Create -> ScriptableObjects`.
- **Prefab-Based**: Assign any prefab you want to a seed and tweak its rules.
- **Flexible Usage**: While intended for trees and foliage, it works with **any** prefab.
- **Customizable Spawning**: The populator/planter takes `SeedObjectData` rules into account when distributing objects.

## Installation and Usage

1. Download/clone this repository or download the package on the release page.
2. Import the SeedPlanter folder into your Unity project.
3. Create a `SeedObjectData` file (`Create -> ScriptableObjects`).
4. Assign your desired prefab and adjust rules.
5. Use the populator to generate objects in your scene.
